# ReCircle

**ReCircle** is a mobile application dedicated to advancing Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production). Our mission is to reduce waste by facilitating the reuse, sharing, and borrowing of items in your local community. With ReCircle, you can easily list items you no longer use, borrow items you need, and connect with others for a more sustainable lifestyle.

## 🌱 Project Purpose

Waste reduction starts with responsible consumption and extending the lifecycle of products. ReCircle helps individuals and communities:
- Share usable items instead of throwing them away.
- Find items to borrow instead of buying new ones.
- Reduce unnecessary purchases and encourage a circular economy.

## ✨ Features

- **List an Item**: Add household goods, electronics, books, clothes, tools, and more for others to borrow or take for free.
- **Browse Listings**: Discover available items nearby you can borrow or pick up.
- **Chat and Connect**: Secure in-app messaging to arrange pickup and discuss item details.
- **Profile and Reputation**: Build trust through user profiles and community ratings.
- **Notifications**: Stay updated with item status, messages, and activity.
